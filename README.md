# Implementing-models-CAN-NAT-V-LAN-using-Cisco-Network-packet-tracer
In this project, basically we have to implement various models by the use of the packet tracer Like, Campus Area Network, NAT(static), VLAN(switch-1). Using this we can design a hierarchical network with dividing the network into 3 different layers which also help us in reducing the network complexity. Todayâ€™s networks are complex and large, wide variety of technology, running multiple services and also having challenges with functionality, increasing demand of bandwidth and compatibility with other businesses and venders. So for designing large networks we need to have such hierarchical model for designing our network.
